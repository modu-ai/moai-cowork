# Design System Inspired by Starbucks

> **Source and portability boundary:** The [Starbucks Creative Expression guide](https://creative.starbucks.com/) is a high-level brand reference, not permission to reuse its logo, photography, product names, or custom fonts. Its [typography guide](https://creative.starbucks.com/typography/) names SoDo Sans, Lander, and Pike. The deployable stack here uses [OFL Inter](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/inter/METADATA.pb) for sans text and [OFL Lora](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/lora/METADATA.pb) for optional editorial serif, with `system-ui, sans-serif` and `Georgia, serif` fallbacks. Check font loading and mixed-script layout on each target OS. Product, price, nutrition, Rewards, and asset rights must be checked at publication.

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

This inspired profile uses warm neutrals and a family of greens. The [official color guide](https://creative.starbucks.com/color/) names Starbucks, Accent, Light, and House greens. The hex values and page compositions below are reference values; confirm current usage before publishing. Gold is a decorative Rewards accent in this interpretation, not a required brand color.

Typography carries most of the brand voice. The source guide names **SoDo Sans** for body copy. Portable UI instructions in this profile use Inter with tracking checked after font load — it reads confident and friendly rather than fashion-magazine severe. The official guide names Lander as an expressive serif and Pike as a condensed face. Optional editorial serif here uses Lora; site-specific Careers handwriting needs separate verification.

The layout reference uses pill buttons, rounded cards, and restrained shadows. The floating order CTA and pressed scale are examples to verify against the current interface; do not force them into every screen.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The official guide names Starbucks, Accent, Light, and House greens; Uplift is an interpretation in this profile, not an official tier
- Gold reserved for Rewards-status moments only; never a general-purpose accent
- Warm-neutral canvas (`#f2f0eb` / `#edebe9`) instead of cold white — references café materials
- Source guide names SoDo Sans; portable sans text uses Inter with tracking checked in the rendered layout
- The source guide also names Lander and Pike; optional portable serif uses Lora
- Pill buttons and pressed-scale feedback are optional reference treatments; measure their rendered targets and focus states
- Floating order circular CTA (`56px`, Green Accent fill, layered shadow stack) — the product's signature elevation element
- Gift-card surfaces need current approved artwork and rights checks; examples are not reusable assets
- 12px card radius + whisper-soft shadows keep content cards flat-plus-hint-of-lift
- Rem-based spacing scale anchored at 1.6rem (~16px) = `--space-3`, stepping to 6.4rem (~64px)

**Color-block page rhythm:** Cream hero → White content sections → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) feature band with white text → Cream utility zone → Dark-green (`#1E3932`) footer with gold / white text — an espresso-dark bookend around the bright body.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

**Historical reference surfaces:** homepage, Rewards, gift cards, and product details. Confirm current content and URLs before publication.

### Primary

- **Starbucks Green** (`#006241`): The historic brand green. Used on h1 headings, primary section headers on the Rewards page, and as the main brand signal wherever a single dominant color is needed.
- **Green Accent** (`#00754A`): A slightly brighter, more luminous green. The primary filled-CTA color (current, verified CTAs) and the fill of the floating floating order circular button.
- **House Green** (`#1E3932`): The deep near-black brand green. Footer surface, feature-band backgrounds, reward-status dark surfaces, and the headline "Free coffee is just the beginning" hero band on Rewards.
- **Green Uplift** (`#2b5148`): An interpretation-only mid-dark green for optional decorative accents; it is not a named official brand tier.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2`): A pale mint wash used for form-valid-state tints and light green utility surfaces.

### Secondary & Accent

- **Gold** (`#cba258`): Decorative Rewards accent in this inspired palette. Use as text only on a verified dark surface; on white it measures 2.37:1.
- **Gold Light** (`#dfc49d`): Softer gold for background washes on gold-tier sections.
- **Gold Lightest** (`#faf6ee`): Cream-gold page-surface wash used under partnership sections on the Rewards page — ties the gold accent back into the warm neutral system.

### Surface & Background

- **White** (`#ffffff`): Primary card and modal surface. Also card fill on gift-card tiles.
- **Neutral Cool** (`#f9f9f9`): Subtle cool-gray surface used on dropdown menus ("Account" dropdown), form-card wraps, and quiet utility containers.
- **Neutral Warm** (`#f2f0eb`): The warm cream **primary page canvas** for Rewards utility zones and hero bands.
- **Ceramic** (`#edebe9`): A slightly warmer/darker cream for zone separators, soft page-section washes, and Rewards partnership band.
- **Black** (`#000000`): Deep ink reserved for the dark top-of-page CTA strip ("Join now") and high-contrast top-nav sign-in buttons.

### Neutrals & Text

- **Text Black** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.87)`): Primary heading and body text color on light surfaces. Not pure black — an 87%-opacity black that reads warmer.
- **Text Black Soft** (`rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.58)`): Secondary/metadata text on light surfaces.
- **Text White** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)`): Primary heading/body text on dark green surfaces.
- **Text White Soft** (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.70)`): Secondary text on dark-green surfaces — footer link descriptions, caption text.
- **Rewards Green** (`#33433d`): A dedicated muted slate-green used only on Rewards-page text blocks — a slightly "dustier" reading color than Text Black that signals "reward surface" without using full Starbucks Green.

### Semantic & Accent

- **Red** (`#c82014`): Error and destructive state (form invalid, destructive actions).
- **Yellow** (`#fbbc05`): Warning state, legacy brand touch.
- **Green Light** (`#d4e9e2` at 33% opacity = `hsl(160 32% 87% / 33%)`): Form valid-field tint background.
- **Red Tint** (`hsl(4 82% 43% / 5%)`): Invalid-field tint on forms.

### Black / White Alpha Ladders

Two parallel translucent scales for overlay and secondary-text use:
- `rgba(0,0,0,0.06)` through `rgba(0,0,0,0.90)` in 10% steps — for dark overlays on light surfaces
- `rgba(255,255,255,0.10)` through `rgba(255,255,255,0.90)` in 10% steps — for light overlays on dark surfaces

### Gradient System

No structural gradient tokens observed. Surface hierarchy is solid-color-block throughout — the system relies on its five-tier cream/green surface palette rather than gradients.

## 3. Typography Rules

### Font Family

- **Source reference:** SoDo Sans, Lander, and Pike are named by the official guide; their reuse rights are not established here.
- **Portable sans:** `Inter, system-ui, sans-serif`; confirm font loading and spacing in the running interface.
- **Optional portable editorial serif:** `Lora, Georgia, serif`; source guide identifies Lander, but this profile does not distribute it.
- **Decorative handwriting:** Source-specific treatment is unverified; use an approved asset and an accessible text alternative if needed.

No OpenType stylistic sets explicitly activated at `:root`.

### Hierarchy

| Role | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Display (text-10) | 5.0rem / 80px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Largest Rewards/hero display |
| Jumbo (text-9) | 3.6rem / 58px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.16px | Secondary hero headings |
| Hero Large (text-8) | 2.8rem / 45px | 400–600 | 1.2–1.5 | -0.16px | Landing section headlines |
| H1 | 24px | 600 | 36px | -0.16px | Starbucks-Green primary heading |
| H2 | 24px | 400 | 36px | -0.16px | Regular-weight section title in Text Black |
| Body Large | 19px | 400–600 | 33.25px (~1.75) | -0.16px | Hero intro copy, feature-band body |
| Body (text-3) | 1.6rem / 16px | 400 | 1.5 (24px) | -0.01em | Default body copy |
| Small (text-2) | 1.4rem / ~14px | 400–600 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Button label, metadata, form labels |
| Micro (text-1) | 1.3rem / ~13px | 400 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Active float-label state, caption micro-copy |
| Button Label | 14–16px | 400–600 | 1.2 | -0.01em | All pill-button labels |

**Letter-spacing tokens:**
- `letterSpacingNormal`: `-0.01em` (default — tight, characteristic)
- `letterSpacingLoose`: `0.1em` (emphasized caps)
- `letterSpacingLooser`: `0.15em` (uppercase-style labels, extreme emphasis)

**Line-height tokens:**
- `lineHeightNormal`: `1.5` (body)
- `lineHeightCompact`: `1.2` (display/buttons)

### Principles

- Check `-0.01em` tracking in the rendered Inter stack; keep letter spacing readable for mixed scripts.
- **Weight shifts carry hierarchy, not size shifts.** H1 and H2 share the same 24px/36px size; only weight (600 vs 400) and color (Starbucks-Green vs Text Black) separate them.
- **Size tokens use rem, anchored to `1rem = 10px`** on this site (via a `font-size: 62.5%` root trick). So `1.6rem` = 16px, `2.4rem` = 24px, etc. The scale is semantic (textSize-1 through textSize-10), not arbitrary pixel values.
- **Context-specific typeface swaps** — serif on Rewards, script on Careers — are deliberate and localized. Never mix them with the primary sans within the same surface.
- **Body text never goes pure black** — it sits at `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` to match the warm-neutral canvas temperature.

### Note on Font Substitutes

The source guide names SoDo Sans; this profile does not establish redistribution rights. Portable sans options include:
- **Inter** (Google Fonts) — similar humanist geometric proportions, wide weight range
- **Manrope** — slightly rounder, similar confident feel
- **Nunito Sans** — warmer, good for a "café" brand substitute

If substituting, verify the tight `-0.01em` / `-0.16px` tracking still reads well; some open-source fonts need `-0.005em` instead.

The portable optional serif is Lora. Check any other source font and its license before loading it.

- Labeled by category above the card grid (Spring, Thank You, Birthday, Celebration, Mother's Day, Appreciation, Encouragement, Milestones, Anytime)

**Rewards Status Cards (current US program requires verification)**
- The [current official US terms](https://www.starbucks.com/terms/rewards/) name Green, Gold, and Reserve levels. Confirm the user's region and current benefits before creating a live card.
- If the current product needs tier cards, use the officially documented Green / Gold / Reserve levels (US program, launched March 2026) and verify region-specific terms before publication. Each panel may use dark green (`#1E3932`) with:
  - Solid-color header ring with verified text contrast
  - Numbered "Level" badge
  - Status title in large Inter weight 600
  - Stars / benefits list in white/translucent-white text
  - Bottom "As you earn more stars…" progression caption

**Partnership Card (Rewards)**

- Combined vertical padding: `11.2rem`
- Radius inherits from card spec (`12px`)

### Inputs & Forms

**Floating Label Input**
- Label floats above the input border when focused/filled
- Desktop label font size: `1.9rem` default, animates to `1.4rem` when active
- Mobile label font size: `1.6rem` default, animates to `1.3rem` active
- Label horizontal offset: `12px` from left
- Active label translate: up to `-12px` with `-50%` Y translation
- Field padding: `12px`
- Visible boundary: `1px solid #767676` on white; show a distinct focus ring and text label
- Form horizontal padding: `1.6rem`

- Uses the checked-input cubic-bezier animation above (a slightly "springy" 2.32 overshoot curve)

### Navigation

**Global Nav (top bar)**
- Fixed position with progressive heights: `64px` xs → `72px` mobile → `83px` tablet → `99px` desktop
- Shadow stack: `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)` — three-layer soft lift

- Primary links inline in Inter weight 400–600: Menu · Rewards · Gift Cards
- Right: Find a store link + Sign in (outlined) + Join now (black filled)

**Sub-nav (second bar, e.g., Rewards internal)**
- Height: `53px` (global subnav) / `48px` (internal subnav)
- Typically horizontal tab group beneath the global nav

**Mobile Nav**
- Collapses to a hamburger drawer below tablet breakpoint
- floating order button appears only when it does not cover navigation or other controls

### Image Treatment

- **Hero photography**: Product photos (beverages in clear glass with colored backgrounds — coral, sage, warm amber) occupy ~40vw of a split-hero layout; text occupies the other 60vw (`--headerCrateProportion: 40vw` / `--contentCrateProportion: 60vw`)
- **Gift card illustrations**: Each card is a distinct illustrated photograph (painted-feel, hand-drawn-looking, warm color palette). Never generic generated graphics.
- **Rewards ceremony imagery**: Photographs of Starbucks Rewards App screens held in-hand, angled compositions — product-in-context photography.
- **Menu thumbnails**: Square or 4:3 product photography with clean white/cream backdrops, slight soft drop-shadow around the glass.
- **Image fade-in**: `opacity 0.3s ease-in` transition on image load (`--imageFadeTransition`).

### Feature Band (dark-green hero strip)

Full-width `#1E3932` (House Green) band with:
- Left: white headline + subhead + CTA row
- Right: product photography or illustration
- Split ratio ~40/60 or 50/50 depending on section
- White text throughout with `rgba(255,255,255,0.70)` for secondary copy
- CTAs follow Green-on-Green Inverted (white filled) + Outlined on Dark (white outline) pairing

### Expander / Accordion

- Duration: `300ms` (`--expanderDuration`)
- Timing curve: `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)` — a measured ease-out
- Used for FAQ sections on Rewards and gift page

## 5. Layout Principles

### Spacing System

Rem-based semantic scale (anchored `1rem = 10px`):

| Token | Rem | Pixels | Typical Use |
|-------|-----|--------|-------------|
| `--space-1` | `0.4rem` | 4px | Tightest inline padding |
| `--space-2` | `0.8rem` | 8px | Small gap, button vertical padding |
| `--space-3` | `1.6rem` | 16px | Default — card padding, outer gutter xs |
| `--space-4` | `2.4rem` | 24px | Section inner spacing, outer gutter md |
| `--space-5` | `3.2rem` | 32px | Major between-section spacing |
| `--space-6` | `4rem` | 40px | Large gaps, outer gutter lg, header crate |
| `--space-7` | `4.8rem` | 48px | Section-to-section spacing |
| `--space-8` | `5.6rem` | 56px | Very large breathing — floating order height |
| `--space-9` | `6.4rem` | 64px | Widest section padding |

**Gutter tokens:**
- `--outerGutter: 1.6rem` (16px, default / mobile)
- `--outerGutterMedium: 2.4rem` (24px, tablet)
- `--outerGutterLarge: 4.0rem` (40px, desktop)

**Spacing reference:** `1.6rem` maps to 16px only when the root font size is 10px. Use the actual root size or pixel values rather than assuming this conversion in a new project.

### Grid & Container

- Column width scale: `--columnWidthSmall: 343px` / `Medium: 500px` / `Large: 720px` / `XLarge: 1440px`
- Gift-card grid uses a 3-5-up responsive grid of `~343px` tiles
- Rewards status section: 3-up dark-green panels at `lg+` breakpoints
- Hero: asymmetric split 40% (image) / 60% (content) via `--headerCrateProportion` / `--contentCrateProportion`

### Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace carries the feeling of "plenty of space in the café." Section padding leans generous (40–64px). Content blocks are separated by whitespace rather than dividers. The cream canvas (`#f2f0eb`) is itself a visual breath between white cards and green feature bands.

### Border Radius Scale

| Value | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `12px` | Cards, modals, menu-item tiles (`--cardBorderRadius`) |
| `12px 12px 0 0` | Full-width feedback tab (top-rounded only) |
| `50px` | All buttons — full-pill radius (`--buttonBorderRadius`) |
| `50%` | Circular icons, floating order button, avatar thumbnails |
| Specialty | `3.3333%/5.298%` elliptical for Starbucks-Visa-Card mockups (`--svcRoundedCorners`) |

## 6. Depth & Elevation

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Card | `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Default content cards — a whisper-soft dual-shadow |
| Global Nav | `0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), 0 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06), 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)` | Triple-layer soft lift on the fixed top bar |
| floating order Base | `0 0 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)` | Base halo around the floating circular CTA |
| floating order Ambient | `0 8px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.14)` | Stacked directional ambient — floats the control forward |
| Gift Card | Light drop shadow around illustrated photograph | Physical-card feel for gift tiles |
| Starbucks Card (SVC) | `drop-shadow(0 4px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.11)) drop-shadow(0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.24))` | Stacked SVG drop shadows for Starbucks Card visuals |

**Shadow philosophy:** Whisper-soft, layered over solid — the system never reaches for a single heavy drop shadow. Instead, it stacks 2–3 low-alpha shadows with different offsets to simulate real-world ambient + direct lighting. A floating order button may have a stronger elevation when the current flow calls for it.

### Decorative Depth

- **No gradient system** — surfaces are solid color-block
- **Color-block banding** carries perceived depth (dark-green bands read as "recessed feature zones" between cream/white body sections)
- **SVG filter shadows** on Starbucks-Card visuals add a slight 3D physicality without a box-shadow

## 7. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) or Ceramic (`#edebe9`) as page canvas instead of pure white — the warm cream is the signature
- Map the documented greens to the intended surface roles; treat Uplift as an optional interpretation rather than an official brand tier
- Check Inter tracking in rendered headings and body text, especially mixed-script content
- Use pill geometry where it suits the control; verify labels, focus, and target sizes
- Use pressed-scale feedback only if the resulting target remains usable and motion preferences are respected
- Reserve Gold for Rewards-status ceremony moments only
- Use Inter for portable sans text; optional editorial serif uses Lora. Check any source-specific script treatment separately
- Layer 2–3 low-alpha shadows instead of one heavier drop shadow for elevation
- Use a floating order entry only when current product flow calls for it; keep it clear of other controls
- Let the cream canvas breathe between content cards — use whitespace, not dividers

### Don't
- Don't use pure white as the page canvas — the warm cream temperature is load-bearing
- Keep the green family present; the exact mix depends on the current context and source assets
- Don't use Gold as a general-purpose accent — it's a Rewards signal only
- Match corner shape to the control role; the reference uses pills for prominent CTAs
- Don't introduce gradient fills — the system is color-block throughout
- Don't weight-contrast h1 and h2 by size — the hierarchy comes from weight + color (600 Starbucks-Green vs 400 Text Black)
- Don't use pure black for body text — `rgba(0,0,0,0.87)` matches the warm canvas
- Provide visible hover, active, and keyboard-focus states; use scale only where it does not reduce target usability
- Don't stack single heavy shadows; always layer 2–3 low-alpha ones
- Don't introduce serifs or scripts into the main shopping flow — they belong to Rewards and Careers contexts respectively

## 8. Responsive Behavior

### Breakpoints

Inferred from component width tokens and progressive nav heights:

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|------|-------|-------------|
| xs | < 480px | Global nav 64px; hamburger menu; single-column layouts; pill buttons full-width |
| Mobile | 480–767px | Global nav 72px; gift-card grid 2-up; card padding tightens |
| Tablet | 768–1023px | Global nav 83px; gift-card grid 3-up; hero split begins to appear |
| Desktop | 1024–1439px | Global nav 99px; gift-card grid 4-up; full asymmetric hero 40/60 |
| XLarge | 1440px+ | Content caps at `--columnWidthXLarge`; gift-card grid 5-up; extra cream margin |

### Touch Targets

- Measure actual rendered button targets and spacing at each breakpoint; padding alone does not establish touch-target compliance.
- Check the floating button's actual target and clearance from system UI on each device.
- Verify any extended hit area in the running UI; negative offsets do not prove a larger target.
- Form float-label inputs grow their label font size on mobile (1.6rem base vs 1.9rem desktop) — easier to tap and read at arm's-length.

### Collapsing Strategy

- **Global nav height scales progressively**: 64 → 72 → 83 → 99px across breakpoints, not a single value
- **Hero split collapses**: 40/60 asymmetric split → stacked (image top, content below) at mobile
- **Gift-card grid**: 5-up → 4-up → 3-up → 2-up → 1-up across breakpoints with adjusted card widths
- **Feature bands**: Stay full-width but text + imagery stack vertically on mobile
- **Outer gutter scales**: 16px → 24px → 40px as viewport grows
- **Rewards 3-column status panels**: Stack to single column on mobile

### Image Behavior

- Hero product photography crops tighter vertically on mobile; content becomes the visual anchor
- Gift-card illustrations preserve aspect ratio; card grid reflows
- `opacity 0.3s ease-in` fade-in transition on image load (prevents jarring pop-in)
- Rewards app-in-hand photography scales proportionally; never stretches

### Example Component Prompts

1. "Create a primary Starbucks CTA pill button with Green Accent (`#00754A`) background, white text 'Explore our afternoon menu', Inter font at 16px weight 600 with `-0.01em` letter-spacing, `50px` border-radius (full pill), `7px 16px` padding. Apply `transform: scale(0.95)` as the active state with a `0.2s ease` transition."

2. "Design a content card with White (`#ffffff`) background at `12px` border-radius, layered shadow `0 0 0.5px rgba(0,0,0,0.14), 0 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.24)`. Pad contents `16–24px` (`--space-3` to `--space-4`). Place on a Neutral Warm (`#f2f0eb`) page canvas with `16px` gap to siblings."

3. "If the current order flow needs a floating CTA, use a 56px circular Green Accent control with an approved icon and accessible name. Verify its target, focus ring, clearance from system UI, and reduced-motion behavior on every breakpoint."

4. "Build a dark-green feature band — full-width section with House Green (`#1E3932`) background. Left column: white Inter h2 at 24px weight 600, followed by a Text White Soft (`rgba(255,255,255,0.70)`) body paragraph and a CTA row with two buttons (White-filled with Green Accent text for primary, Outlined-on-Dark white border for secondary). Right column: product photography. Split ratio 40/60, stacked vertically below `768px`."

5. "Create a Rewards status card — House Green (`#1E3932`) panel with `12px` border-radius, a tier heading based on the current Green, Gold, or Reserve level (US program). Title in Inter 24px weight 600 in white. Benefits list as white bullets with `rgba(255,255,255,0.70)` secondary captions. Bottom progression text in Text White Soft. Stack 3 panels in a grid at `lg+`, single column on mobile."

6. "Design a gift-card tile with a `12px` radius and current approved artwork whose reuse rights are confirmed. Preserve its aspect ratio, provide accessible text, and use current category names from the catalog. A subtle shadow may separate it from the cream canvas."

7. "Create a product-detail header using current approved product data and photography. Use a House Green band with white text, a verified breadcrumb and product title, and a size selector whose names, options, and prices come from the current catalog. Give the selected size a visible ring and an accessible selected state."

8. "Build a customizable product form with clearly labeled fields, visible input borders and focus rings, and a numeric stepper whose buttons have accessible names and measured targets. Use current catalog options and approved icons."

9. "Design a House Green product description band with a Rewards item marker only when current eligibility and redemption data support it. Show verified nutrition values and ingredient links. Keep the gold marker on the dark surface and check the rendered contrast."

10. "Create a Starbucks nutrition facts table — two-column layout inside a White card. Left column: 'Ingredients' header (24/400 Text Black), followed by ingredient list or 'Not available for this item' placeholder paragraph in 14/400 Text Black Soft. Right column: 'Nutrition' header, then label/value rows (nutrient name left, value right) separated by `1px solid #e7e7e7` hairlines. Typography: labels in 14/400 Text Black, values in 14/700 Text Black right-aligned. Footnote asterisk markers in 13/400 Text Black Soft at the bottom."

### Iteration Guide

When refining existing screens generated with this design system:
1. Focus on ONE component at a time
2. Reference specific color names and hex codes from this document
3. Use natural descriptions ("warm cream canvas," "green family") alongside exact reference values
4. Keep pill geometry where appropriate and verify target size, focus, and active feedback
5. Check that greens are mapped to their correct role (Green Accent for CTA, Starbucks Green for heading, House Green for band)
6. Don't introduce gradients — the system is color-block
7. Check Inter spacing after font loading and at each target breakpoint

### Known Gaps

- SoDo Sans, Lander, and Pike are source references. Portable text uses Inter and optional Lora; confirm loading and license obligations.
- Current Rewards details, product content, photography, logos, and font loading need live verification on each target platform.
- Specific per-component animation timings beyond the few documented (`--duration: 0.4s`, `--iconTransition: all ease-out 0.2s`, `--expanderDuration: 300ms`) are not captured for every interactive surface
- Form error-state full styling (red border weight, icon placement) visible on the tint token but not exhaustively extracted
- Careers-page specific components (cup-name card, search radio grid) are referenced in token names but not covered by this extraction
- Starbucks Visa Card / Starbucks-Card (SVC) detailed mockup specs are hinted at by `--svcRoundedCorners` and `--svcShadowFilter` tokens but not fully documented
