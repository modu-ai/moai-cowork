> MoAI-Cowork V.0.1.3 Harness Reference

## Overview
A harness where an agent team collaborates to perform multilingual translation, localization, cultural adaptation, and terminology management.

## Expert Roles
- **localizer**: Localization expert. Adapts translated text to the cultural context of the target market. Handles idioms, metaphors, units of measurement, currency, date/time formats, and cultural sensitivities.
- **quality-reviewer**: Translation quality reviewer (QA). Systematically verifies translation accuracy, fluency, terminology consistency, and localization suitability, calculating MQM-based quality scores.
- **style-harmonizer**: Style harmonizer. Maintains consistent tone and voice, writing style, and formality level throughout the translation. Applies brand voice appropriately to the target language.
- **terminology-manager**: Terminology Management. Translation toof Glossary(Glossary) ·and, before Terminologyof Translation ensure. Industry standards Terminologyand Terminology manage.
- **translator**: before Translation. Source textof of, Nuance, context Analysisand Target languageto naturally . of, Source textof ofand Preservation Translation perform.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Preparation (Performed Directly by the Orchestrator)

1. Extract from user input:
 - **Source text**: Translation Text File
 - **Source text language / Target language**: Translation 
 - **** (Selection): IT/of///
 - **Target market** (Selection): specific /
 - **Style Guide** (Selection): Brand , Formality level
 - ** Glossary** (Selection): before to Glossary
2. `_workspace/` to in generate
3. Organize input and save to `_workspace/00_input.md`in save
4. If existing files are present `_workspace/`, copy to _workspace/ and skip the corresponding Phase
5. Based on the scope of the request **determine the execution mode** ( " per mode" )

### Phase 2: Team Assembly and Execution

 compositionand . between of relationship and :

| sequence | | | of | |
|------|------|------|------|--------|
| 1a | Source text Analysis·Translation Strategy | translator | None | `_workspace/01_source_analysis.md` |
| 1b | Glossary | terminology | None | `_workspace/02_terminology.md` |
| 2 | 1 Translation | translator | 1b | `_workspace/03_translation.md` |
| 3 | Localization application | localizer | 2 | `_workspace/04_localization.md` |
| 3+ | Style | harmonizer | 3 | `_workspace/04_localization.md` |
| 4 | quality verification | reviewer | 2, 3, 3+ | `_workspace/05_review_report.md` |

 1a(Source text Analysis)and 1b(Glossary ) **executed in parallel**.

**Inter-team communication flow:**
- terminology complete -> translatorTo Glossary before (Translation when before )
- translator complete -> localizerTo 1 Translated text + before
- localizer complete -> harmonizerTo Localization application + before
- harmonizer complete -> reviewerTo Style application and before
- reviewer cross-validate. 🔴 Must Fix when AgentTo → → Verification (vs 2)

### Phase 3: Integration and Final Deliverables

Reviewof based on :

1. `_workspace/` within File verify
2. from the review report 🔴 Must Fix reflected verify
3. summary To :
 - Source text Analysis — `01_source_analysis.md`
 - Glossary — `02_terminology.md`
 - Translated text — `03_translation.md`
 - Localization and — `04_localization.md`
 - Quality — `05_review_report.md`

## Deliverables
- `00_input.md` — Organized user input
- `01_source_analysis.md` — Source analysis/translation strategy
- `02_terminology.md` — Glossary
- `03_translation.md` — Translated text
- `04_localization.md` — Localization applied results
- `05_review_report.md` — Quality review report
